Very simple Events Plugin Created By Peter Featherstone @ Network Intellect

== Description ==

This is a very small, simple events plugin.

Please note that I have created this plugin as a personal project to use across various sites that I make, therefore there will be no custom support or feature requests in regards this plugin.

You are of course more than welcome to use it however if you wish and it fulfils your needs.

It currently supports the following shortcode:

[ni-events] - Shows all events with all types
